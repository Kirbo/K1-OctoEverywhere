        # First of all, we need to figure out what the URL is. There are two options
        #
        # 1) Absolute URLs
        # These are the easiest, because we just want to make a request to exactly what the absolute URL is. These are used
        # when the OctoPrint portal is trying to make an local LAN http request to the same device or even a different device.
        # For these to work properly on a remote browser, the OctoEverywhere service will detect and convert the URLs in to encoded relative
        # URLs for the portal. This ensures when the remote browser tries to access the HTTP endpoint, it will hit OctoEverywhere. The OctoEverywhere
        # server detects the special relative URL, decodes the absolute URL, and sends that in the OctoMessage as "AbsUrl". For these URLs we just try
        # to hit them and we take whatever we get, we don't care if fails or not.
        #
        # 2) Relative Urls
        # These Urls are the most common, standard URLs. The browser makes the relative requests to the same hostname:port as it's currently
        # on. However, for our setup its a little more complex. The issue is the OctoEverywhere plugin not knowing how the user's system is setup.
        # The plugin can with 100% certainty query and know the port OctoPrint's http server is running on directly. So we do that to know exactly what
        # OctoPrint server to talk to. (consider there might be multiple instances running on one device.)
        #
        # But, the other most common use case for http calls are the webcam streams to mjpegstreamer. This is the tricky part. There are two ways it can be
        # setup. 1) the webcam stream uses an absolute local LAN url with the ip and port. This is covered by the absolute URL system above. 2) The webcam stream
        # uses a relative URL and haproxy handles detecting the webcam path to send it to the proper mjpegstreamer instance. This is the tricky one, because we can't
        # directly query or know what the correct port for haproxy or mjpegstreamer is. We could look at the configs, but a user might not setup the configs in the
        # standard places. So to fix the issue, we use logic in the frontend JS to determine if a web browser is connecting locally, and if so what the port is. That gives
        # use a reliable way to know what port haproxy is running on. It sends that to the plugin, which is then given here as `localHttpProxyPort`.
        #
        # The last problem is knowing which calls should be sent to OctoPrint directly and which should be sent to haproxy. We can't rely on any URL matching, because
        # the user can setup the webcam stream to start with anything they want. So the method we use right now is to simply always request to OctoPrint first, and if we
        # get a 404 back try the haproxy. This adds a little bit of unneeded overhead, but it works really well to cover all of the cases.
